Since youthhood I've had a passion for business studies, it's been a dream to achieve an MBA. Though after completing my Bachelor's in Commerce, and until a couple of years back; I was caught up in being the all-in-one family woman, this included managing the household, work and raising two adorable sons, all this while migrating to New Zealand in 2002.

The journey included a lot of hard work, but gifted me with financial stability and the chance to see the world a few times round, along with professional experiences such as Practice Manager and other accountant roles held for various psychiatric firms, medical institutions, designers, tech-companies for around a decade. 

Selecting Massey's Executive MBA programme was by reputation and commendation, I've always been someone to prioritise quality, whether it be academia or materials. Earlier I had taken a gap year from studies, a breather, even with above-average grades coming back immediately into the student life was a big change. 

Now that the boys are grown up, I'm settled without any immediate worries, I feel free to pursue and complete the Executive MBA from Massey University.
